This script lets you play Conway's Game of Life (see the [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) page) on a structured surface grid.

The script as delivered is configured to run automatically a demo of Conway's Game of Life with a single Gosper's Glider Gun configuration (see the [video](http://youtu.be/4KJz-kXvFGo) on YouTube). Open the sample file and execute the script. You'll be able to select which domain to run the demo on, either a simple square or an O-grid around an airfoil.

The built-in demo can be run on your own grids as long as they're at least 42 x 37 points.

You can turn off demo mode by editing the script and changing the value of the variable "hardcoded" to 0. Then after you select the domain, the script lets you choose which grid cells start out as living.

The script is set to run 200 generations. To change that just change the value of variable "numGenerations."
